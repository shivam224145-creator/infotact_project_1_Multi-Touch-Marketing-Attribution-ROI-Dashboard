# Multi-Touch Marketing Attribution & ROI Dashboard
### Project Overview
The goal of this project is to build a Multi-Touch Marketing Attribution and ROI Dashboard that helps marketing teams understand how different channels contribute to customer conversions and revenue generation.

Traditional last-click attribution often assigns all conversion credit to the final interaction. This project aims to implement more advanced attribution methodologies such as First-Touch, Last-Touch, and Linear Attribution to provide a more accurate view of marketing performance.

The final solution will integrate customer journey data, campaign information, transaction records, and customer demographics to calculate marketing effectiveness metrics and support data-driven decision making.

### Tools & Technologies
- Python (Pandas, NumPy)
- PostgreSQL
- Power BI
- Jupyter Notebook
- Git & GitHub

### Dataset Overview
The project uses five interconnected datasets:-

### Events Table
Contains customer interactions such as views, clicks, add-to-cart actions, purchases, and bounces.

### Transactions Table
Contains purchase transactions, revenue information, discounts, and refund indicators.

### Campaigns Table
Contains campaign metadata including channel, objective, target segment, and expected uplift.

### Customers Table
Contains customer demographic and acquisition information.

### Products Table
Contains product category, brand, pricing, and premium status information.

### Project Progress
### Day 1 – Dataset Research & Selection
